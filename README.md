Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser the response or see it in your terminal.\
This commnad also create the build folder for production

### `npm run lint`
we use this script to pass esLint rules to have better code.

### `npm run clean`
we use rimraf to clean the build folder, sometimes when we install and our server is running sometimes crash, so rimraf is to force the project to build "build" folder again
